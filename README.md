BigInteger List and Arithmetic
==============

List
---------
> List ADT that creates a doubly linked list. Cursor lies between two nodes allowing
> access to the ones on the left and right. See List.h for specific client functions

BigInteger
---------
> Uses the List ADT to create "big integers." Modeled by nodes in a linked list,
> you can do basic operations (+, -, *) of extremely large numbers. 
>
> Can convert strings into numbers, and can include a preceding + or - to indicate
> positive or negative numbers.

Arithmetic
----------
 > Usage "./Arithmetic input_file output_file"
 > The input file must contain 3 lines, the first number followed by a blank line
 > and the the second number
 >
 > Computes a couple of basic operations on the given two numbers and outputs them into the output file.

 > Operations: 𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐴 + 𝐵, 𝐴 − 𝐵, 𝐴 − 𝐴, 3𝐴 − 2𝐵, 𝐴𝐵, 𝐴^2, 𝐵^2, 9𝐴^4 + 16𝐵^5
 > Each operation output is split by an empty line in the output
